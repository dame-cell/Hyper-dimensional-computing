# Hyper-dimensional-computing
> How does the brain work? 

It doesn’t process information word by word or token by token. Instead, it operates on higher-level abstractions—concepts, ideas, patterns. That’s what inspired me when I read about the Large Concept Model (LCM) and how it reasons using abstract concept embeddings.

The paper by Meta [LCM](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.08821) moves beyond token-level processing and works in a concept space, which feels a lot like how our brain organizes thoughts. Similarly, Hyper-Dimensional Computing (HDC) uses high-dimensional vectors to encode and process information, mirroring how the brain handles large amounts of data efficiently and robustly.

This project is an experiment to explore and understand Hyper-Dimensional Computing (HDC). It's a hands-on way for me to learn by experimenting and trying things out—nothing too fancy or ambitious, just diving in and seeing how it works.
